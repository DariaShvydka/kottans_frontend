## :heavy_check_mark: Task 0

 - I learned more about pull-requests and about conflicts.
 - Much of materials that I saw was already familiar to me,  so I was only positively surprised by the humor of Caroline and Sarah from the lessons.
 - Basically, I'm using all standard commands like git -init, -commit,  -push, -merge, -status. But now I will use diff, log and many others that I learned.
 

## :heavy_check_mark: Task 1

 - For me new knowledge were third course "Networking for Web Developers" and the installation of a virtual machine, although in almost all lessons I used my native Bash (I have OS X), but it was good experience.
 - I was surprised by the work with traffic of firewall devices, I did not know that such devices exist. And the funny name of the linux command "cat". é¾´â†€â—¡â†€é¾´
- I consolidate the knowledge of commands in the terminal and in the future I plan to work with files only through bash.
And also this week I will need an installed virtual machine, but for using os windows, because I received a new project at my work, which requires the browser Edge. :sweat:

## :heavy_check_mark: Task 2

 - I never thought about that Version Control is everywhere, in all work with documents. In second course "GitHub & Collaboration" was familiar information to me, except forking repositories.
- Was surprised that small gray text at the top in Google doc is a link that I can click on and look at history changes. 
- I work with github for my personal projects and with bitbucket at work. Therefore, the information was rather familiar, but allowed to strengthen knowledge and fill gaps in knowledge.

__[Attached screenshots of passed materials](https://github.com/DariaShvydka/kottans_frontend/tree/master/task_3)__

- I have learned more about the encoding ASCII and found quite useful text editor Emacs.
- To be honest â€“ nothing, cause Iâ€™m already work like html-css coder ðŸ˜ƒ. 
- All knowledge that was provided in the course, I used previously and am going to use them it further.

## :heavy_check_mark: Task 4
__[Attached screenshots of passed materials](https://github.com/DariaShvydka/kottans_frontend/tree/master/task_4)__

__Lesson 1:__
Using Dev Tools On Android Mobile with browser Google Canary was really cool, easy, useful and totally new and surprised me.
Finally found good responsinator, which I will definitely use in future.

__Lesson 2:__
Surprised, that our fingers are about ten millimeters wide, or half an inch, which works out to be about 40 css pixels. And in that case â€“ tap targets at mobiles must be at least 40 pixels.
Always started to coding from medium and large screens, moving toward tablets and mobile devices. Now I want to start coding designs from smallest viewport to bigger.

__Lesson 3:__
Lesson was about media queries and breakpoints, so it isnâ€™t new to me.

__Lesson 4:__
I remembered about orders in flexbox. It was quite helpful stuff.
I didnâ€™t know that mobile-hamburger menu sounds like Off Canvas :) 

__Lesson 5:__
I was surprised that the ideal measure about 65 characters per line.
And I remembered a small recommendation, which I plan to use in the future for mobile design:
16px font-size
1.2em line height

## :heavy_check_mark: Task 5
__[Attached screenshots of passed materials](https://github.com/DariaShvydka/kottans_frontend/tree/master/task_5)__

__Lesson 1:__
I saved shortcuts for chrome devtool <https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts>
That was usefully :) 

__Lesson 2:__
Nothing new, but I repeated booleans equations, thats was helpful.

__Lesson 3:__
I remembered logical operators and switch case statement. that never used in my work. I hope I will using this statement in future, when there are suitable tasks for it.

__Lesson 4:__
I really like loops, but always used Â«forÂ». In this lesson I understood how to correctly use while and nested loops)
Never thought in that direction, that the incrementing or decrementing step we can mark like Â«How to get to the next itemÂ». Helpful thing)  

__Lesson 5:__
I understood important thing, thatÂ Â«returnÂ»Â andÂ Â«printÂ are not the same thing. Printing a value to the JavaScript console only displays a value (that you can view for debugging purposes), but the value it displays can't really be used for anything more than that. 
Was really interesting to learn the concept hoisting â€“ variable and function declarations are put into memory during theÂ compileÂ phase, but stays exactly where you typed it in your coding. JavaScript hoists function declarations and variable declarations to the top of the current scope.

__Lesson 6:__
For myself I learned better method, slice (), that returns a new array, that containing a copy of the part of the original array and had practice with forEach() loop.

__Lesson 7:__
If be clear â€“ nothing. The objects were treated superficially and I already knew all the information.
