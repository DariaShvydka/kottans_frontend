## :heavy_check_mark: Task 0

 - I learned more about pull-requests and about conflicts.
 - Much of materials that I saw was already familiar to me,  so I was only positively surprised by the humor of Caroline and Sarah from the lessons.
 - Basically, I'm using all standard commands like git -init, -commit,  -push, -merge, -status. But now I will use diff, log and many others that I learned.
 
 
## :heavy_check_mark: Task 1

 - For me new knowledge were third course "Networking for Web Developers" and the installation of a virtual machine, although in almost all lessons I used my native Bash (I have OS X), but it was good experience.
 - I was surprised by the work with traffic of firewall devices, I did not know that such devices exist. And the funny name of the linux command "cat". 龴ↀ◡ↀ龴
- I consolidate the knowledge of commands in the terminal and in the future I plan to work with files only through bash.
And also this week I will need an installed virtual machine, but for using os windows, because I received a new project at my work, which requires the browser Edge. :sweat:
