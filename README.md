## :heavy_check_mark: Task 0

 - I learned more about pull-requests and about conflicts.
 - Much of materials that I saw was already familiar to me,  so I was only positively surprised by the humor of Caroline and Sarah from the lessons.
 - Basically, I'm using all standard commands like git -init, -commit,  -push, -merge, -status. But now I will use diff, log and many others that I learned.
